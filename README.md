TranslationApp is a C# console application that translates technical terms from English to Serbian using Google's Gemini AI model.  
The application is designed to assist with translating terminology related to power tools and machinery, but you can customize it.

It allows users to input multiple terms, processes them in batches, and outputs structured translations.

This project was created for learning and practice purposes, focusing on:
- Working with external AI APIs
- Prompt engineering
- Batch processing
- Error handling and retries
- Console application flow control
